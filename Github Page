## The problem

Social workers face a significant burden in finding emergency shelters for homeless youth. Our project aims to alleviate the workload and facilitate the search process for social workers, 
providing them with a solution that streamlines and simplifies the task.

## The solution

We provide a centralized program that lists all available social services in one convenient platform.

## Test Prototype
